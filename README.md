# Star Trek Adventures Solo RPG
## Character LifePath Generator

This Java console app will run the player through the Life Path Character Generation Process as described in Captain's Log Solo RolePlaying Game.  The game author is Modiphius.

This is a project in progress.

I hope to change this to a web app via Spring Boot and Thymeleaf eventually.  

Apologies, but for now, it runs as a -jar app only.

Also, the ability to have mixed race characters has not been realized.

As always, use at your own risk.
