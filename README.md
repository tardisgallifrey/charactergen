# Star Trek Adventures Solo RPG
## Character LifePath Generator

This Java console app will run the player through the Life Path Character Generation Process as described in Captain's Log Solo RolePlaying Game.  The game author is Modiphius.

This is a project in progress.
I have finished up to step 2 in the LifePath as per the book.

I hope to change this to a web app via Spring Boot and Thymeleaf eventually.  

Apologies, but for now, it runs as a -jar app only. The current jar file is in the root directory if you just wish the output.

Also, the ability to have mixed species characters has not been realized.

As always, use at your own risk.
